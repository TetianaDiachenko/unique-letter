# unique-letter
Implementation of the task in JavaScript in the search for a unique letter

The task was to develop an algorithm for a program that should do the following:

- the program accepts an arbitrary text as input and finds in each word of this text the very first symbol that is NOT repeated in the analyzed word;
- further, from the received set of symbols, the program must select the first unique one (that is, the one that is no longer found in the set) and return it.
